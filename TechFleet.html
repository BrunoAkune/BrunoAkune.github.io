            <p>
                I collaborated with the design team to implement the report feature insights into the high-fi prototypes. We tested older report features versions and evaluated the new versionUsing the agile methodology, as the sprints happened we were constantly testing and changing the prototypes according to the feedback.

            </p>
            <p>
                The project is halfway done as future sprints will focus on refining and developing the platform. However, the phase 1 research team focused in aligning the expectations of the stakeholders to what is possible to create and guide them into success.
            </p>

            <p>
                One moment that highlights the impact of research was when we tested the report feature, the more we tested and interviewed users and stakeholders we found that their needs were different. Since I was in charge of the feature, I focused in communicating to stakeholders what their users expect and help them review the feature's effectiveness for future version.

                “I’m blown away by what all of you have created. It’s going to be such a gift and such a big impact in the life of the community….This is like the key to what we were looking for all this while. Our WhatsApp groups are like maxed out at 400 and we have about 750 students and everyone’s posting pictures and asking and sharing stories. Having this platform where each and every person will have access to it and would get to see all the amazing things that people are telling them or sharing with them. Wow. I am just, I’m telling you, I have goosebumps and I’m blown away by everything that all of you have shared. Thank you, thank you, thank you!”
